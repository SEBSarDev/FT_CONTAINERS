# FT_CONTAINERS
Deepening of knowledge in cpp language

 In this school 42 project, we had to recode a little part of the CPP containers library :
 - Vector
 - Stack
 - Map
 And their iterator and reverse-iterator.
 It bring me a good comprehension of this library and an improvment of my code in cpp.
 
 To test it, I wrote 2 programs, that do the same things, but one of it use my code containers, and the other use the official containers library.
You can do a 
 ```
 $ make
 $ ./MineVector
 $ ./OriginalVector
 ```
 to compare results.
